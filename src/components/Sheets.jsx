/* 
For me: don't forget the .env updates

Note: Dropdown, code missing in tutorial. Looks like I need to install
react-dropdown (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dropdown)

 Going to add some notes here, the tutorial for "Build an Online Retail
 Dashboard in React" is woefully lacking. I am integrating it into my 
 project here so already paring it down. I am slightly tempted to re-create
 it with better/more complete instructions and an open source charting
 tool. First I will get it working here then maybe work through a new
 tutorial.
